# Responsive Personal CV Website – Design Overview

This document outlines a modern layout for a personal CV website. The design focuses on clarity and an engaging presentation of skills, certifications, and projects while remaining fully responsive.

## Desktop Layout

### Header
- **Logo/Name:** Display your name or personal brand in the top-left corner.
- **Navigation Bar:** Links to *About Me*, *Projects*, *Skills*, *Certifications*, and *Contact*. Include a contrasting call-to-action button, e.g., **Download CV**.

### Hero Section
- **Headline:** Statements like "Engineering Ideas That Matter" or "Robotics & Code That Drive Impact".
- **Subheadline:** "I'm a robotics and software engineer specializing in real-world systems that blend AI, vision, and automation."
- **Primary CTA:** A button such as **Explore My Work** or **Get in Touch**.
- **Visuals:** Rounded images or project screenshots (robot arms, dashboards, ROS systems) with curved shapes or wave patterns for visual flow.

## “First Impressions” Section
- Dark-themed area titled **First Impressions** with an icon (rocket, robot, code brackets, etc.).
- Two-column tagline:
  - *Focusing on practical innovation*
  - *Rooted in system-level thinking*
- Highlighted quote or statement such as “Technology should not just work — it should scale, adapt, and inspire.”

## Skills & Certifications Section
- Split grid layout that groups skills and certifications.
- Possible groupings:
  - **Robotics & AI:** Python, C++, ROS 2, OpenCV, YOLO
  - **Web & Data:** React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MQTT
  - **DevOps & Tools:** Docker, Git, Linux, Redis, TIA Portal
- Include certification badges (SolidWorks, VCA, etc.).

## Projects Section
- Card or grid layout with screenshots, titles, and short blurbs. Example projects:
  - *Autonomous Greenhouse Monitor* – ROS 2 + GPS + MQTT
  - *Strava-integrated Fitness Tracker* – FastAPI + Next.js + PostgreSQL

## Mobile View
- Stack layout vertically with a hamburger menu for navigation.
- Maintain the same clean design while adapting fonts and button sizes for smaller screens.
- Floating images and shapes should adjust to a single-column display while preserving readability and smooth scrolling.
