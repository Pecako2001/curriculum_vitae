  "about": {
    "heading": "Who I Am",
    "paragraph": "I’m Koen van Wijlick — a mechatronics engineer delving into artificial intelligence. I am driven to make technology smarter, more sustainable, and more human-centered. From an early age, I’m fascinated by how mechatronic systems come to life when guided by intelligent software. This curiosity leads me to study Mechatronics, where I focus on robotics, computer vision, and autonomous systems. I thrive at the intersection of hardware and software — integrating smart electrical components, building intelligent control systems, and extracting valuable insights from camera feeds using machine learning. My approach revolves around clear communication, collaboration, and fast, thoughtful iteration. Whether I’m optimizing embedded systems or sketching new interface ideas, I strive to develop solutions that are not only technically robust but also benefit people and the planet. Do you share the same passion for technology that truly makes a difference?"
