      "The GrowBot is an autonomous greenhouse robot designed to optimize crop growth through real-time data collection and AI analysis. It navigates independently between plant rows, measuring environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Using computer vision and machine learning, it assesses plant health, detects issues early, and tracks growth. Based on this data, it suggests or triggers adjustments to improve growing conditions. GrowBot supports sustainable agriculture by enabling precise, data-driven cultivation and reducing manual intervention.",

    description:
      "This machine vision system was developed as part of research into automated harvesting of bell peppers. It uses computer vision techniques and deep learning models to detect and localize ripe peppers in real-time from RGB images. The system was trained to identify different ripeness stages. Built using frameworks like YOLO, OpenCV, the project demonstrates practical application of AI in agriculture, contributing to more efficient and selective harvesting processes in controlled environments such as greenhouses.",
